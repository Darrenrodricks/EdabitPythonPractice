* This series of python activities was very fun and challenging. It was quite refreshing to practice projects that have fun concepts and projects that made me struggle a lot more.  I thinksincestarting working on activities, this site had the most flexibility on difficlty and options to choose from. Overall some concepts covered were lsit comprehension, loops, variable swapping, indexing and string concateenation. I enjoyed working on these activites and look forward to making more.
